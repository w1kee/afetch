NOTE: you can use my design of the instantos ascii art everywhere you want, as i no longer am a user of instantos i no longer maintain this program

my edit of [13-CF/afetch](https://github.com/13-CF/afetch)

there are some settings reconfigured, and an [instantOS](https://instantos.io) logo is displayed
